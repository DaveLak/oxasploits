**Rougetooth Bluetooth HID injection attack**

*This is 0day as of Apr 21, 2023*

*setup*

Need to run `sudo systemctl stop bluetooth`, then run: `bluetoothd -P input`.

Now pair the device, and: `sudo ./run.sh`.  Now on the phone, tap on the computer's controller alias in the bluetooth screen, and the exploit should proceed.

It should try to push the file, then accept the file itself by bringing up a HID controller on the computer side, and emulating the keypresses needed
from a hardware keyboard to accept the transfer.  This is a benign proof of concept, but uploading a meterpreter shell and running it this way is possible.


*Tested on: linux kernel 6.1.12, bluetoothd 5.66, python libraries: python-xlib 0.27, dbus-python 1.2.16*

Have fun, and be safe!
