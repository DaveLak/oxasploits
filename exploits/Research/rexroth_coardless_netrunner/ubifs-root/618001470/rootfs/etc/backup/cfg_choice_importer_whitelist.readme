File structure:
------------------
Example:
{
  "PLC Signals":
    {
        "target-dir": "plctab",
        "filter": "mod_(.*).lua$",
        "root-only": true,
        "additional-target-files": {
            "ResSrv.json": true,
            "vwXmlCfg.json": false
        },
        "item-text" : "(.+?)\\.[^\\.]+$",
        "expandable" : true
      },
....
}

Description:
-----------------
"PLC Signals": is the group name
"target-dir": this is the directory name in config/ which this group may include some or all of its files
"filter": This is a strong regex to use to match file names. If empyt, all files are selected in this directory.
"root-only": true/false: when set to  true, it means search for target files only in the given directory and exclude all subdirectories. Otherwise the search includes all.

"additional-target-files":
{"path1/subpath1/fname1": true, "path2/subpath2/fname2": false}
this is a dictionary of files with full path in "config/" whose keys are the target files and values are true: meaning that the file is required and must be found in the
configuration file and restore may not take place, or false: meaning that when the is not found it is just ignored and the restore may take place.

"item-text" : e.g "(.+?)\\.[^\\.]+$"  or "". This flag states how to display the item text in the group list in regex format.
Empty string "", means the full name with path.
Any other text must be a legal regular expression which is performed on the file name.

"expandable" : true/false When set to true, the group is expanded and the user may see the group content and select single items. When false the group remains collapsed (closed)
and the user does not see the single items nor is able to select/deselect items individually.
